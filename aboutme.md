I’m currently a M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the Computational Design Group from the Université de Montréal. I work on the science of twister candy! under the supervision of Bernhard Thomaszewski. I’m also a member of LIGUM(Laboratoire d’Informatique Graphique de l’Université de Montréal).

A short description of my training, I was drawn to continuous and discrete (Fluid Dynamics and Kinetic Theory) by J. Muñoz, taught FEM by J. Galvis, DG-FEM by X. Zhang(张翔雄), Lattice Boltzmann by M. Mendoza, inter alia.

B.Sc. Physics Universidad Nacional de Colombia (2018)

Montréal, QC, Canada.
